<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Simon Chang.  This is my first real web project I have ever done.</p>

<p>My previous experience was in online marketing and analytics.  Due to the inconsistencies of employment,
  I've decided to start learning web development.
</p>

<p>Through these learning modules, I hope to pass the initial bootcamp assessments to take my first real
  steps into becoming a web developer.
